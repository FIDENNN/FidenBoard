# FidenBoard
FidenBoard is a custom keyboard for ImGui projects that uses ImGui::Button() function. 

Why i did this? well on my android ImGui project i nedded to use an input text/number, but i had so many problems trying to show the phone keyboard, i know that there is a way to do it, but i decided to make my own way and share it here.

Im open to all suggestions so just tell me what you don't understand and how you would improve the project

TO INCLUDE IT
you just need to copy the header file in your project and include it in any part of your main file, BUT you need to include it after including "imgui.h"

p.s
mention to italiz
